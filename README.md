*PiXART is a simple pixel art painting tool utilizing only a few concepts of C language.*
<br /><br />

PiXART is a beginner project for C Programming, it is designed to demonstrate the basics of C language (Input/Output, control flow, looping, etc.), yet still be able to produce an interesting program despite the lack of more complex and powerful function or libraries used in the program.

It is also intended to demonstrate user-friendly concepts by writing the program with CLI-based interface and handling error by eliminating user-defined input.
